<h2 id="encryption.exe">1. Encryption.exe</h2>
<p>This file creates another .txt file which stores the codes, that are <strong>FUNDAMENTAL</strong> for the decryption, don’t delete this, do not edit anything and don’t <strong>PLEASE</strong> don’t move it out of the folder. Be aware that the Encryption.exe, the .txt and the Decryption.exe <strong>HAVE</strong> to be in the <strong>EXACT SAME FOLDER</strong> or else it will break my shit.</p>
<h3 id="soooo...-how-does-this-encryption-stuff-work">Soooo… how does <em>this</em> encryption stuff work?</h3>
<ol>
<li>You enter a sentence, word or anything really, except numbers and special characters, this only works for normal characters thanks</li>
<li>It gives each unique character a unique ID, encrypts it by multiplying the ID by 16384 because I felt like it and then it encrypts it into Base64</li>
<li>It quickly decrypts the sentence, so you can actually see the encrypted and decrypted input at the end. Pretty simple</li>
<li>It creates a .txt file, which contains the unique ID of every single character in the message</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="decryption.exe">2. Decryption.exe</h2>
<p>This uses the .txt file to decrypt everything from the .txt file, thats why you shouldn’t delete or edit it to decrypt it.</p>
<ol>
<li>It loads each line from the .txt file</li>
<li>Decrypts the Codes from the .txt file into ascii and then divides the number by 16384</li>
<li>Converts the number into an Ascii-Character</li>
<li>Shows the Decrypted Text at the end.</li>
</ol>
